# Title:  	99 Bottles
# Author: 	Thomas Luong
# Purpose:	A program printing out every line to the song "99 bottles of beer on the wall"
# Usage:	To practice Loops

# Notes:	Besides the phrase "take one down", can't manually type numbers/names into song
#			When reached 1 bottle left, "bottles" becomes singular
